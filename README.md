# TAMatching
For a college with many teaching assistants and academic courses, every T.A. has some preferences regarding the courses s/he would like to teach. This tool helps to find a good enough (if not optimal) assignment of TA's per courses.
To try this tool, there's a sample input in "sample_input.xlsx" file. You can run the tool with this input file, and leave the parameters written in the program's interface unchanged. An output file named "output.xlsx" will be generated containing the best distribution of courses over TA's.
